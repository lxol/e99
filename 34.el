;;  Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).
;;
;;  Euler's so-called totient function phi(m) is defined as the number
;;  of positive integers r (1 <= r < m) that are coprime to m.
;;
;;  Example: m = 10: r = 1,3,7,9; thus phi(m) = 4. Note the special
;;  case: phi(1) = 1.
;;
;;  (totient-phi 10)
;;  4
;;
;;  Find out what the value of phi(m) is if m is a prime number.
;;  Euler's totient function plays an important role in one of the
;;  most widely used public key cryptography methods (RSA). In this
;;  exercise you should use the most primitive method to calculate
;;  this function (there are smarter ways that we shall discuss
;;  later).
