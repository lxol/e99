;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater
;;  than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It
;;  is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been
;;  proved to be correct in the general case. It has been
;;  /numerically/ confirmed up to very large numbers (much larger than
;;  we can go with our Lisp system). Write a function to find the
;;  two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
