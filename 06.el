;;  Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
;;
;;  A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).
;;
;;; Code:

(defun palindrome-p (lst)
  "True if LST is a palindrome."
  (equal lst (reverse lst)))

(ert-deftest Q06 ()
  (should (palindrome-p '(x a m a x)))

  (should (not (palindrome-p '(x m a a x))))

  (should (palindrome-p nil))

  (require 'e99utils)
  (should (palindrome-p (repeat-n 'x 1000)))
)
